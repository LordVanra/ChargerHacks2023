			<h3><b>
			Why is Plastic Pollution Happening?
			</h3></b>
		<article>
			<p>Ever since the 1960s and early 70s, our beloved Earth has been "poisoned" as one would say, 
			in the ever-rampant mess known as plastic pollution. The cause of this mess is, well, us human beings.
			The first thing the reader must know, however, is that plastic is an extremely cheap and easily accessible material.
			It's cheap because it's created from the remains of oil manifacturing, making this material very cheap and it's 
			produced in great amounts. That, and the fact that it's very versatile. It can be a grocery bag, a solid insulator, 
			used in textiles, and much, much more. These are the main factors that propel us to use plastic in everyday life.
			Plastic is tempting and accessible to use in all fields across the world, and the fact that our population on Earth is
			growing as well, is not a good sign. Plastic also takes more than 400 years to decompose, which means that we can not
			stop this problem very easily. If dire changes are not made soon, then our next generations will have to suffer.</p>

			Why is Plastic Pollution Harmful to Our Earth?
			</h3></b>
		<article>
			<p>Plastic Pollution is the most harmful thing on our planet right now, but why? To answer this question, one must look deeper
		into what plastic really is. Plastic is made up of many different esters, but two of the most vile products found in plastic's
		"genetic variation" are Bisphenol A (BPA)and Pthalates. Let's take a look at BPA first. BPA is recognized as an "endocrine disruptor",
		which means that BPA a compound that prevents organic hormones from securing on to each other. This chemocal compound also infects air, dust, 
		and water in the environment. 	Even worse, BPA is linked with many cancers, most notably, breast cancer. So, as one can see, plastic is not only harmful for 
		the environment, but also for the ones who live in the environment. That includes plants as well, because when high levels of  BPA are reached in the environment,
		plants' ability to peform photosynthesis effieciently are reduced. Many people in our world today believe that plastic only has a small effect
		on the environment, but it has a large one, as well as huge effects on us <em><b>humans</b></em>.</p>

			Why is Nothing Being Done About Plastic Pollution, and What Can <em>I</em> Do to Lessen the Effects?
		</h3></b>
		<article>
			<p>
			After reading this article, the Pollution Awareness Group hopes that the reader is more informed and globally aware on this preposterous situation.	
			Then, the question might arouse, why is nothing being done by the government to address this problem. Well, even in th 60s when plastic pollution
			became a problem, the government pushed this matter away, as no one in the government believed it to be a serious problem. This trend continued to 
			go on and on, until the late 2010s, when <em>part</em> of the government saw th this distardly situation. The key word, though, is part. Still, to 
			this day many people believe that plastic pollution and climate change are not real problems. Now, the government is trying to implement new laws and 
			barriers on the usage, production, and recycling of plastic, but many believe it to be too late. After all, we have been putting this off for the last 
			60 years, and now we must pay the price. But, there is a sliver of hope. <b>You</b> as the reader, can do some things to help solve this problem and lessen
			the effects of plastic pollution. Start riding bicycles to places that are a short distance away, instead of driving. You don't need to completely eradicate
			meats from your diet, but eat less meat. Bring paper grocery bags to grocery shops instead of using plastic bags. And these are just a few suggestions. Also, 
			don't say that "one person can't change everything", because if you do something, then others will follow along. But you as the reader must act quickly towards solving this problem, because if 
			you start doing things too late, then it might be <em> "too late"</em> for our world.</p></div>
