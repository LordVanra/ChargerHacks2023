		Why is Plastic Pollution Happening?
		</h3><b>
	</div>
		<div><p>
			Ever since the 1960s and early 70s, our beloved Earth has been "poisoned" as one would say, 
		in the ever-rampant mess known as plastic pollution. The cause of this mess is, well, us human beings.
		The first thing the reader must know, however, is that plastic is an extremely cheap and easily accessible material.
		It's cheap because it's created from the remains of oil manifacturing, making this material very cheap and it's 
		produced in great amounts.
