			Why is Plastic Pollution Happening?
			</h3><b>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Ever since the 1960s and early 70s, our beloved Earth has been "poisoned" as one would say, 
			in the ever-rampant mess known as plastic pollution. The cause of this mess is, well, us human beings.
			The first thing the reader must know, however, is that plastic is an extremely cheap and easily accessible material.
			It's cheap because it's created from the remains of oil manifacturing, making this material very cheap and it's 
			produced in great amounts. That, and the fact that it' very versatile. It can be a grocery bag, a solid insulator, 
			used in textiles, and much, much more. These are the main factors that propel us to use plastic in everyday life.
			Plastic is tempting and accessible to use in all fields across the world, and the fact that our population on Earth is
			growing as well, is not a good sign. Plastic also takes more than 400 years to decompose, which means that we can not
			stop this problem very easily. If dire changes are not made soon, then our next generations will have to suffer.</p>

					Why is Plastic Pollution Harmful to Our Earth?
					</h3></b>
					
				</div>
		<div><p>
		Plastic Pollution is the most harmful thing on our planet right now, but why? To answer this question, one must look deeper
		into what plastic really is. Plastic is made up of many different esters, but two of the most vile products found in plastic's
		"genetic variation" are Bisphenol A(BPA)and Pthalates. Let's take a look at BPA first. BPA is recognized as an "endocrine disruptor",
		which means that BPA a compound that prevents organic hormones from securing on to each other. This chemocal compound also infects air, dust, 
		and water in the environment. 	Even worse, BPA is linked with many cancers, most notably, breast cancer. So, as one can see, plastic is not only harmful for 
		the environment, but also for the ones who live in the environment. That includes plants as well, because when high levels of  BPA are reached in the environment,
		plants' ability to peform photosynthesis effieciently are reduced. Many people in our world today believe that plastic only has a small effect
		on the environment, but it has a large one, as well as huge effects on us <em><b>humans and plants</b></em>.
